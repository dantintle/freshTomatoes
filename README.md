Dan’s Fresh Tomatoes Program

Special Valentine’s Day theme! All red everything! If you’re looking to pick a movie to watch for Valentine’s Day, but you don't want a rom-com, meet her halfway and watch something with red in the poster!

Use the media.py file to update what parameters you want in the Movie class.
Comes with movieTitle, movieStoryline, posterImage (takes URL), trailerURL, and rating as parameters.

In entertainmentCenter.py, pick what movies you want displayed on the site. At the bottom there is a function imported from the fresh_tomatoes.py, which takes the movies list at the bottom and iterates it onto the page.

Uses Bootstrap for styling, with certain styles added in head.
